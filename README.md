# Vert-Recorder-iOS-AR-App

I made an augmented reality app that allows people who do not have access to a basketball hoop or vertical jump measuring equipment to track their jumping progress. 

I created the app during the summer after my freshman year of college.




Features include:
- Augment a basketball hoop into the world that always faces the camera
- Augment a ruler/measurer into the world that always faces the camera
- Recording, replay, and share buttons
- Automatically saves videos to photos and creates a separate folder with all vertical jump recordings
- My own app icon drawings 
- I created all 3D models in Fusion 360
- My own icons / drawings in the app
